Hi my name is Abcd Xyz. How are you today? Hey! I am fine, what about you?
Thank you! 
You are welcome.
Winston is one of the most laid-back people I know. 
He is tall and slim with black hair, and he always wears a t-shirt and black jeans. 
His jeans have holes in them, and his baseball boots are scruffy, too. 
He usually sits at the back of the class, and he often seems to be asleep. 
However, when the exam results are given out he always gets an "A". 
I don't think he's as lazy as he appears to be.
