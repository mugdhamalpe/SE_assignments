DSL Assignment 1

1. In second year, computer engineering class,
  group A studentâ€™s play cricket,
  group B students play badminton and
  group C students play football.
  Write a Python program using functions to compute following: <br>
a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton <br>
b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both <br>
c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton <br>
d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton. <br>
(Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, do not use SET built-in functions)
